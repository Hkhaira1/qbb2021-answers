### Comments

Great: Nice use of a function to make the kmer dictionary! Good variable names too.

To improve: How will you print cases where a kmer has more than one match in the query sequence? Also, another option for looping through the target sequences is to write `for target_name, target_dna in f2` instead of `for i in f2; target_name = i[0]; target_dna = i[1]`.
