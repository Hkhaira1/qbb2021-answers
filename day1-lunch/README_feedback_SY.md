### Comments

Great: I like that you wrote out your incomplete command for question 4! Exactly the kind of notes you want to keep so that you can pick up from where you left off in the future.

To improve: It would be great to have better documentation of the command-line commands - splitting it up by question, adding notes about what each line is doing.

### Completion:

README with code
