### Comments

Great: Clean recording of command-line commends!

To improve: It would be great to have better documentation of the command-line commands - splitting it up by question, adding notes about what each line is doing.

### Completion:

Found:
README with code
directory.txt
feature_count.txt
fbgenes.info

Missing:
chr-with-fbgenes-k9.txt
