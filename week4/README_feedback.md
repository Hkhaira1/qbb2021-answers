Hi Harjit, 

- It looks like you're missing the step where you'd extract the methylation data (-0.5) 
- I think as a result of that your plots for the histograms and scatter aren't showing us what they're asked (-2) 
- So, can you do the extraction and then re-plot? 

2.5/5

- I extracted the data and reploted it.
