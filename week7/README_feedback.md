Really really good! A few small notes: first, it looks like you're not intializing the first row and column of the traceback matrix. This shouldn't be a big deal for the example sequences we gave you but it's an important part of the algorithm (-0.1) Additionally, when you're doing traceback, horizontal arrows should be gaps in sequence 1, and vertical arrows should be gaps in sequence 2 (-0.25) Finally, when you're printing the output, I think you want `\t` and `\n` rather than `|t` and `|n`, otherwise the output doesn't look quite right.
