Hi Harjit! 
- For the Manhattan, we wanted you to label the 5 most significant SNPs (with their rsIDs) and plot the most significant SNPs in a different color. Can you do this? (-0.5)
- For the qq and box plots, I'd like more effective labelling - I'm left wondering which dataset (and for the bp, which SNP) we're looking at 
- I'm not sure what we're looking at in this boxplot https://github.com/Hkhaira1/qbb2021-answers/blob/main/week3/Boxplot_GS451_rs7257475.jpeg. The other boxplot looks great!
