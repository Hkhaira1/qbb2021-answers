- The output files from bowtie2 aren't index files; they're .sam files (it's ok just want you to get in the habit of using file suffixes that are informative and helpful to you) 
- You're missing a couple of commands that help you find the features that are ONLY in G1E or ER4 (-1)
- For the right panel of the bar chart, you need to show the sites gained and lost sorted by region (exon, intron, promoter) (-1)
- The motif sequence doesn't look quite right. Can you review how you extract the sequences? (your commands for meme-chip and tomtom look okay) (-0.5)
