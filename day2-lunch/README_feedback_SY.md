### Comments

Great: Great use of print to see what your data looks like at different parts of the script.

To improve: You can convert a list into a string and print it out by using `.join()`, which will make your output more aesthetically pleasing. You might also consider directly replacing the gene ID with the uniprot ID, instead of just adding on the uniprot ID.
