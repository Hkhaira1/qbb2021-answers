### Comments

Great: I really like the use of `current_index` as the midpoint variable name instead of "mid". I think it avoids a lot of confusion about how the while loop is looping through indices in the list, not genomic positions.

To improve: Your documentation is good, but I think you can still be more explicit about what the lines are doing. For example, when you compare your current index to the low and high indices, what does that comparison mean? These are the kinds of things you'll want to have in your code if you're using it for data analysis/experiments.
