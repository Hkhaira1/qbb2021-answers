### Comments

Great: Good plot labeling!

To improve: Add answers for "Is this relationship significant?" and "What is the size of this relationship?" for the regression sections. To estimate the # of mutations for a 50.5 yo male, you should correct for fact that your coefficient and intercept are for a Poisson distribution by either using `results_p.params` or plugging them into the formula for a poisson regression (e^(intercept + coeff*predictor variable)).
